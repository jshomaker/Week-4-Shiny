Example Shiny App: shinycars

This example app shows how engine displacement varies with MPG for specific car cylinders.
The user can change the number of cylinders and the graph highlights the car models with those
number of cylinders and their displacement and MPG. The graph also provides a fitted linear
model to show how the relationship between displacement and MPG varies by cylinder count.

The easiest way to run the application is to go to this URL:
